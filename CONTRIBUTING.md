# Contributing Guidelines for Cryptoauthtools

## Issues

describe the sequence of events encountered if the bug requires any special
steps to reproduce.

For new features or examples please describe the use case in detail and what

## Pull Requests

This repository does not have a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).
Because there is no CLA currently, pull requests will be reviewed as per the
issues above and taken as bug reports or suggestions. Rather than opening
a pull request it would be better to open an issue. When a CLA has been added
to this project this section will be updated with guidelines and you'll be
prompted to sign it before the pull request will be reviewed and merged.
